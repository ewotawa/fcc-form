# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects
## Build a Survey Form

I built this front-end page to complete the freeCodeCamp assignment [Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) in the Responsive Web Design certification.

The inspiration comes from a segment on the [tastytrade](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/) network by Vonetta Logan called *Will Tom Eat It?*

The formal assignment is submitted in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ewotawa/full/bGppvoP).
